I made the landing page of an e-Learning video platform for kids in HTML/CSS/JS & React. It was a conversion of a provided Figma model.

The app is tablet responsive. It includes : 

- Responsive CSS grid for videos displaying 
- Collapsable burger menu 
- Custom video player using Plyr library. 
- Reusable React components

Completion time: 2 days.
